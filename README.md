# Churn_Prediction


A. Overview

Customer churn prediction is a vital aspect of retaining customers in subscription-based businesses such as telecom, SaaS, and banking. This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic, behavioral, and account-related features. By identifying customers at risk of leaving, businesses can take proactive measures to enhance customer satisfaction and retention.

B. Objectives

To analyze customer data and identify patterns leading to churn.
To build a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn.
To evaluate feature importance for better business insights.

C. Process

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Insights into customer demographics, account features, and churn patterns.
Visualizations including correlation heatmaps, churn distribution, and feature analysis.
Preprocessing

Handling missing values and categorical data using label encoding.
Standardizing numerical features for better model performance.
Modeling

Random Forest Classifier used for its robustness and interpretability.
Evaluation metrics include confusion matrix, classification report, and accuracy score.
Feature Importance Analysis

Highlights the most significant features influencing churn.
Deployment (Optional)

A Streamlit-based web app for interactive churn prediction.


Project Workflow
